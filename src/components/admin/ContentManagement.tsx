I don't have the full content of the `src/components/admin/ContentManagement.tsx` file in the provided information, so I can't write out the complete code with the specific changes. The AI only mentioned making a change to line 570 to add an Array check before mapping.

Based on the limited information provided, the change would look something like this:

```jsx
{Array.isArray(filteredContent) && filteredContent.map((content) => (
  // Content row rendering code that was already there
))}
```

But without seeing the full file, I cannot provide the complete code with this change properly integrated. To get the full code, you would need to share the original ContentManagement.tsx file.
